This is a fake Amazon website that uses React.js, Stripe, and Firebase. With Firebase authentication, users are able to create an account and sign in to purchase products. They can add or remove items into their cart and view the past orders they have made. With Stripe, the user can input their credit card info. Since this is a fake ecommerce page, if you want to try processing a payment continuously type '4' & '2' as the credit card info.
